## Description

This webpage is an excercise in cleaning up and organizing code. In it, we organized HTML and CSS syntax, repaired broken links, organized headers, added a title and alt img attributes. Perhaps most crucially, it provided an opportuntiy to practice git workflow with making and merging various branches to solve each issue. The code should meet all acceptance criteria.
